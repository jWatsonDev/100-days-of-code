### Day 2: May 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed ionic project for iOS deployment (very simple app) and started pipeline process (Azure DevOps). 

**Thoughts:** Again, I think I may buy a back. I may toggle more to more of an IaC approach until I have Mac or path iOS path forward.

**Today's Progress**: Researched Ionic iOS deployment and scaffolded ionic project for iOS deployment. 

**Thoughts:** Plan to sign up for Apple dev acct soon. Even considering purchasing mac as that's what I use for work, but I wouldn't use my work computer for personal projects.
