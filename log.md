**Thoughts:** Punch the clock.

### Day 6: May 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Distraction alert. Today, I realized that I'll likely soon be working with Oracle Cloud, so actually studied OCI a bit and plan to get the initial cert. Also, worked with Terraform. 

**Thoughts:** I may celebrate Cinco de Mayo, today.

### Day 2: May 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed ionic project for iOS deployment (very simple app) and started pipeline process (Azure DevOps).

### Day 1: May 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Researched Ionic iOS deployment and scaffolded ionic project for iOS deployment. 

**Thoughts:** Plan to sign up for Apple dev acct soon. Even considering purchasing mac as that's what I use for work, but I wouldn't use my work computer for personal projects.
