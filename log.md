# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Researched Ionic iOS deployment and scaffolded ionic project for iOS deployment. 

**Thoughts:** Plan to sign up for Apple dev acct soon. Even considering purchasing mac as that's what I use for work, but I wouldn't use my work computer for personal projects.
