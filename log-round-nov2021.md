# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

#### Start Date
Nov 7, 2021

## Additional Rules
1. I will Parler/MeWee about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.

## Goals
1. Improve DevOps, IaC, and automation skills
2. Improve in the following technologies: Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS, Azure, etc.
3. Goals may evolve depending upon what I need to learn more about for work

### Day 0: Nov. 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Installed Jenkins in AWS. Took longer than it should've. Will automate in the future. 

**Thoughts:** Although I have a coupld certs, DevOps is somewhat of a weakness imo. Turn weakness into strength with practice and preparation. 2 Tim. 2:7
